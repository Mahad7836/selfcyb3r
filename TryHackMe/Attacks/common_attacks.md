# TryHackMe "Common Attacks"

## 1. What’s the point of this room?

This room is like a mini crash course on the cyberattacks that happen most often—and how you can stay safe. It’s designed to be completed in about 40 minutes and packs straightforward exercises and clear explanations to help you recognize, understand, and defend against everyday attacks.

## 2. Social Engineering – Hacking People, Not Computers

It starts by reminding you that the most dangerous hack might be the one that tricks you, not your device. For instance, attackers can manipulate humans far more easily than high-end firewalls.

### Real-World Example: Stuxnet’s Delivery Method

Remember that infamous Stuxnet worm used against Iran’s nuclear program? It wasn’t sent over the internet—it was carried in via USB sticks that workers unknowingly plugged into their systems. That’s social engineering in action.

How to Stay Safe:

Always verify who's calling or messaging you—prefer official channels.

Never plug random USB devices into your device.

Use multi-layered authentication, even for phone calls.

Teach others around you to do the same.

## 3. Phishing – Fake But Foolproof?

Then you’re led through how phishing works—typically via email, but also via SMS (smishing) and voice calls (vishing). It’s all about tricking you into entering credentials into a doctored site or downloading malware.

Username Tricks:
General phishing: random victims.

Spearphishing: targeted groups.
Whaling: high-profile individuals (e.g., CEOs).

Watch Out For:
Suspicious links (hover over them to check the real URL).
Poor grammar or generic greetings in emails.

Domains that look almost correct—a single character’s difference can be fatal.

## 4. Malware & Ransomware – When Files Fight Back

The next section dives into malware—software that secretly steals or damages data. Ransomware, for instance, locks your data and demands money (usually in Bitcoin) to release it.

How It Spreads

Often via phishing emails forcing you to open attachments or enable macros.
Or through unpatched systems and exploitable services.

Smart Defense:

Keep all your software updated.
Don’t click on sketchy links or attachments.
Back up your files regularly.
Never pay ransom—disconnect and call authorities instead.

## 5. Passwords & Authentication – Breakable Only If You Make It Easy

Passwords are everywhere, but they’re also the weakest link when used improperly. Whether it’s brute-forcing, guessing, or reusing, attackers often don’t need fancy tools—they follow the weakest path.

Strong vs Weak:

Strong: Long, random passphrases.
Weak: Personal info like "John1990!"—easy to guess if someone knows you.

Better Options:
Use passphrases or completely random strings.
Store them in a password manager so you don’t have to remember a dozen passwords.

Extra Protection:
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)—the second step like an OTP (Time‑based One Time Password) or an authenticator app keeps you safer even if your password is compromised.

### TL;DR—Why It Matters

Social Engineering: The trick isn’t in hacking code—it’s in hacking you.

Phishing: Trust your eyes—hover over links and verify domains.

Malware/Ransomware: Always back up and stay updated—don’t trust everything you open.

Passwords: Random, unique, long beats memorable and predictable.

MFA: Adds layers that thieves can’t just click through.
