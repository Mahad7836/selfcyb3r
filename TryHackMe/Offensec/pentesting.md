 # 1. What is Penetration Testing?
Penetration testing (pentesting) is a legal, controlled process where authorized testers simulate attacks to identify and help remediate vulnerabilities before malicious actors do.
It’s more like a security stress-test, not chaos—executed under strict authorization agreements.

# ⚖️ 2. Ethics & Rules of Engagement
White Hat hackers operate with permission and within legal boundaries. Black Hat hackers act maliciously. Grey Hats fall in between.
A Rules of Engagement (ROE) outlines scope, allowed tools/methods, and consent—all formalized before testing.

You are a White Hat.
If you steal data, you’re a Black Hat.
The document defining testing setup is the Rules of Engagement.


# 🛠 3. Pentesting Methodology
The systematic pentesting workflow typically includes:

Information Gathering: Public data collection (OSINT) without interacting with systems.

Enumeration/Scanning: Identifying active services using tools like nmap.

Exploitation: Leveraging vulnerabilities to gain initial access.

Privilege Escalation: Achieving higher-level access—horizontally (other users) or vertically (admins).

Post-Exploitation: Pivoting, gathering data, clearing traces, and creating a report.


# 🧱 4. Pentesting Frameworks
OSSTMM: Suitable for networks, telecoms; highly detailed but can be dense.

OWASP: Focused on web application testing; widely used and straightforward.

NIST CSF, NCSC CAF: Used for broader cybersecurity governance and infrastructure testing.


# 🔍 5. Testing Scopes: Black, Grey, White Box
Black‑box: No internal info; simulates an attacker. Labor-intensive.

Grey‑box: Some shared info; balanced between realism and efficiency.

White‑box: Full internal data; thorough, but not realistic attacker perspective.
