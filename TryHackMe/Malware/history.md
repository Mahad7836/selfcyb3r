# Overview of the History of Malware

Covers the earliest malware—from theoretical viruses in 1949 through real-world infections—highlighting how concepts like self-replication and network propagation emerged over time


# ✅The Creeper Program
Creator of the concept: John von Neumann (1949) 
Written by Bob Thomas, 1971, on TENEX OS on PDP‑10
Used ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) to replicate
Displayed: “I’m the creeper, catch me if you can!”
Initially self‑deleting older copies before moving
Redesigned by Ray Tomlinson to replicate without deleting older versions, causing potential nuisance 
ARPA stands for Advanced Research Projects Agency; data traveled via packet switching on ARPANET
Network Control Program managed by the Network Working Group 

# ✅Reaper
Developed by Ray Tomlinson to remove Creeper copies—considered the first anti‑virus (“nematode”) 
Bob Thomas aimed to develop a scalable resource-sharing system
API = Application Programming Interface 

# ✅Wabbit (Rabbit)
Self-replicating malware from 1974; name references Looney Tunes (“Wabbit”)
Created infinite loops of new processes—one of the first truly malicious worms
PERVADE module added in 1975 

# ✅ANIMAL (Trojan)
Spreads across UNIVAC computers; effectively the first Trojan
PERVADE module also added in 1975
Built as “The Trojan Horse”—by the Greeks
John von Neumann reportedly supported the experiment


# ✅Elk Cloner
Created by Richard Skrenta in 1982 on Apple II
Boot‑sector virus spread via floppy disks
Displayed a 7‑line poem on the 50th boot-up
Took ~2 weeks to write; infected US Navy disks
Boot‑sector viruses are far less common today 

# ✅The Morris Internet Worm
Released by Robert Tappan Morris in 1988
Exploited Berkeley r‑commands (rsh, rexec), Sendmail, and weak passwords
Caused a denial-of-service (fork bomb), infecting ~2,000 systems in 15 hours
Morris was first convicted under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
rsh = remote shell 


# ✅Cascade Virus
Known simply as Cascade; infected .COM files on DOS systems
Used rudimentary encryption and had ~40 variants
Infected file size increased by ~1704 bytes
Avoided IBM systems specifically
On specific dates (e.g. Oct 1, Dec 31), displayed falling text and emitted noises 


| Malware         | Year   | Platform         | Mechanism                            | Notable Feature                              |
| --------------- | ------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Creeper         | 1971   | ARPANET / TENEX  | Simple replicator with print message | First viral software concept                 |
| Reaper          | \~1972 | ARPANET / TENEX  | Nematode virus remover               | First antivirus                              |
| Wabbit (Rabbit) | 1974   | Mainframes       | Self-replicating worm                | Early fork loop                              |
| ANIMAL (Trojan) | 1975   | UNIVAC systems   | Trojan disguised as utility          | First Trojan horse malware                   |
| Elk Cloner      | 1982   | Apple II         | Boot-sector virus via floppy         | First “in the wild” micro‑computer virus     |
| Morris Worm     | 1988   | UNIX systems     | Network exploit-based worm           | First major contagion; legal case            |
| Cascade         | \~1987 | DOS (.COM files) | Encrypted file infection             | Visual and audio payload, avoids IBM systems |
