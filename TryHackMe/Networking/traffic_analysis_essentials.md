# Traffic Analysis Essentials

==============================
= Task 1: Introduction
==============================
- **Network Security** protects data, applications, devices, and systems on the network.
- Focuses on architecture, operations, management, accessibility, integrity, continuity, reliability.
- **Traffic Analysis** (Network Traffic Analysis) investigates network data to detect anomalies and issues.
- Recommended to complete the “Network Fundamentals” module before this room 

==============================
= Task 2: Network Security & Network Data
==============================
- Core concepts:  
  - **Authentication**  
  - **Authorization**
- Network security operations span three control levels (e.g., policy creation, access control, threat control)—details in the room’s tables 
- **Managed Security Services (MSS)** and **MSSPs** help organizations without sufficient in‑house resources 
- Answer the room’s questions by referencing the provided tables directly

==============================
= Task 3: Traffic Analysis
==============================
- **Definition**: Intercepting, recording, monitoring, and analyzing network communications to detect performance issues, anomalies, threats 
- Related disciplines:
  - Sniffing/Packet Analysis (Wireshark)
  - Network Monitoring (Zeek)
  - IDS/IPS (Snort)
  - Network Forensics (NetworkMiner)
  - Threat Hunting (Brim) 
- **Techniques**:
  - Flow Analysis: Network statistics overview (e.g., dashboarding).
  - Packet Analysis: Deep dive into individual packets.
- **Benefits**:
  - Full network visibility
  - Baseline establishment for assets
  - Detection and response to anomalies 

**Level‑1 Simulation – Malicious IP Detection**
- Click “Start Network Traffic”; then “Restore the Network” to log traffic.
- Identify suspicious IPs from IDS/IPS; enter them into the filter and Restart traffic.
- **Flag 1**: `THM{P*****T_M*****R}` 

**Level‑2 Simulation – IP & Port Blocking**
- Identify suspicious destination ports from the Traffic Analyzer.
- Enter ports into the filter; restart traffic.
- **Flag 2**: `THM{D********_MASTER}`

==============================
= Task 4: Conclusion
==============================
- Covered:
  - Key facets of network security operations
  - Fundamentals of traffic analysis techniques and workflows
- You are now ready to move on to more advanced modules in Network Security and Traffic Analysis.

==============================
Summary
==============================
- Traffic analysis remains a vital skill—network data, even if encrypted, reveals patterns.
- Understand and apply both **flow analysis** (overview, anomalies) and **packet analysis** (detailed inspection).
- Practical use-case: filtering by IPs and ports to neutralize malicious traffic in a simulated environment.
